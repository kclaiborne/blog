    <p>Hailing from Queens, New York, and currently residing in the Bay Area, Kendra studied Computer Science during her undergraduate studies. She started her career in consulting as a developer designing and building custom implementations on the Salesforce platform for clients in industries such as Higher Education and Technology. Today she's at Box helping a small team of developers build and scale the Salesforce implementation for internal Boxers in Sales, Marketing, Customer Success, and Go To Market. She has worked on integrations using APIs and 3rd party middleware tools, implemented custom classes and triggers using Apex and SOQL, and dabbled in front-end development using visualforce, javascript, and the lightning component framework.</p>
    
    <p>With a passion for bringing awareness and resolution to the diversity and inclusions issues in tech, she's always looking for ways to get involved in and outside of the office. Whether it be going back to her alma mater to help the recruiting team streamline students, speaking on panels about her journey and perspectives, or going to conferences that target an audience of underrepresented groups on how they can break into tech or discuss how tech plays a role in social justice. Being aware of the problem is only half the battle and she's always looking for courses of action that will improve the entry and retention rates of people of color, women and other underrepresented groups.</p>

    <p>This minimal, static site, was built using Jekyll, an open source software written in Ruby. HTML, CSS, and a bit of Javascript were the languages used for the front-end development. It is hosted by Github Pages and version controlled on GitHub.</p>
