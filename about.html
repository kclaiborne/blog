    <p>Hey, I'm Kendra Claiborne. I'm a recent college graduate (GO UB BULLS!) working at a consulting company as a Junior Salesforce Developer.</p>

    <p>I enjoy learning and sharing my knowledge of programming, and this site is a personal project to further those interests.</p>

    <p>This site is compiled with a Ruby static site generator, Jekyll, and is built with HTML, CSS, and a bit of Javascript. The site is hosted and version controlled on GitHub Pages.</p>
