<p>Code2040 allowed for the space to have conversations around tech, racial equity and justice for Black, Latinx, and our allies. I felt inspired and enlightened by the breakout sections that the attendees were welcomed to discuss call out culture, gentrification, and intersectionality leadership.</p>

<p>The gentrification discussion resonated with me the most. It’s a tough reality to see communities of all ethnicities being pushed out at the expense of capital and socioeconomic gains. My hometown in Queens, New York, specifically Cambria Heights, has not been impacted by gentrification. I have a sense of pride every time I go back home and see the abundance of black owned local businesses and my fellow neighbors flourishing as home owners. I do not see that here in the Bay, and it is disappointing and frustrating. One of the speakers offered a great course of action. “With the income of everyone in this room we could buy an area in the Bay and create our own community.” Those were not the exact words, but remnants of what one of the speakers spoke. How can we have more conversations like this to get that plan in motion?</p>
