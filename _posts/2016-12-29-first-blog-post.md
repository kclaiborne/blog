<p>This is just a placeholder until the 'real' writing...</p>

<p>Hey reader! My name is Kendra and I'm the author of this site. Currently I work at a consulting company as a Analyst Salesforce Developer. I was recently in Buffalo, NY up until December 23rd when I relocated back to my hometown of New York City. Buffalo was great, but I was yearning for the excitement of NYC.</p>

<p>This site was created out of my interest of technical blogs/writings, the want to increase my ability to write about technical topics, and have a personal project to work on outside of work that would allow me to expand my working knowledge of frontend development (HTML, CSS, and Javascript).</p>

<p>This is a static site made with Jekyll (that's a post I'm going to write about sometime soon once my knowledge of Jekyll has expanded a bit). My next post will most likely be about the errors I ran into while getting Jekyll up and running...</p>

<p> Until then, keep checking back for the next post!</p>
