<p>Hey! Thanks for stopping by, or if you just so happened to stumble to my site through the black abyss, otherwise known as the world wide web.. welcome! This site here is my work outside of work. I post about technical things that I've worked on, I'm currently working on, or I'm in pursuit of working on. Just to get introductions out of the way, my name is Kendra, NYC, 23, Salesforce Developer, SUNY at Buffalo Alumni (B.S. of CS). Please refer to any of the links to the left to see more about me, or refer to my posts below to learn something new.
